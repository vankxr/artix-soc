Playing with a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA

This repository contains a very basic example of an ARM Cortex-M3 softcore processor running on a Basys3 development board.
It includes an AXI GPIO controller, an AXI UARTLite controller, and an AXI 7-segment display driver.
Software for the ARM Core is also provided.
